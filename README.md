# CIB-Personalized-Marketing-Campaign
Credit card usage is widely popular across the whole world, yet in Egypt, credit card usage is still very low when compared to other countries. Although many people have bank account and credit cards, they still do not use their credit cards as much as people in other countries. This may be due to the lack of technology in Egyptian businesses. This discourages credit card owners of paying through their credit cards because they usually have a reasonable amount of cash with them for their daily needs and they tend to use the cash instead of cards. Banks try to motivate their customers to use their credit cards more often. Recently, there has been marketing campaigns to encourage card usage, including cash-back rewards, lower interest rates, etc. However, most of these marketing campaigns are general, they do not target a specific market segment. We will try and personalize the marketing campaigns for the customers. Using data science and machine learning algorithms, we will segment the customers and assign a personalized marketing campaign to each segment. Thanks to the dataset provided to us by the Commercial International Bank in Egypt, CIB, we will analyse the data and work on it to design a model that can help us in segmenting the customers.
